    Providing object inheritance; the correct way!
    (Sub-)Classes are linked through their table meta-methods until they finally get instanciated.
    (This way we can extend parent classes even after their creation while still being able to see these extesions in the sub-classes.)
    Instances are shallow copies of their entire inheritance chain.
    (At which point they become unique objects without any relation to their parents.)
